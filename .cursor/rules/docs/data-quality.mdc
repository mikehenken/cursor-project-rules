## Data Quality Standards
- Every piece of retrieved data MUST include a confidence score (0-100%)
- Document data sources and retrieval timestamps
- Indicate any assumptions or limitations in the data

## Verification Protocol
- Perform validation checks during task execution
- After completing the task AND providing the summary, conduct a FINAL comprehensive error check on all data
- The final verification is supplementary to—not a replacement for—ongoing validation
- Report any discrepancies found in the final check
