## Repository Creation Rules

### Mandatory User Approval
- **NEVER** create GitHub repositories without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** ask: "Should I create a GitHub repository for this project?" before:
  - Creating any repository creation scripts
  - Implementing any application logic that creates repositories
  - Running any commands that create repositories

### Repository Creation Protocol
1. **Initial Check**: When a repository creation task is mentioned:
   - Pause and ask for explicit confirmation
   - Present the proposed repository details (name, visibility, owner)
   - Wait for user approval before proceeding

2. **Script Creation**: If approved:
   - Use the reusable `scripts/create-github-repo.sh` script
   - Confirm repository settings before execution
   - Provide clear feedback on creation status

3. **Safety Measures**:
   - Default to private repositories unless explicitly requested otherwise
   - Always display repository URL after successful creation
   - Handle existing repository names gracefully

### Example Interaction
```
User: "Create a GitHub repo for this project"
AI: "Should I create a GitHub repository for this project? I'll need:
- Repository name: [suggested-name]
- Owner/Organization: [owner]
- Visibility: Private (default)

Would you like me to proceed with creating this repository?"
```

### Script Usage
- The project includes a reusable script at `scripts/create-github-repo.sh`
- Use `-y` flag for automated workflows after initial approval
- Script supports templates, descriptions, and remote configuration
