## Code Hygiene
- Do NOT create README files unless explicitly requested
- Clean up all temporary files, scripts, and helper files after task completion
- Remove unused imports, commented code, and debug statements

## Project Organization
- Create logical directory structures with appropriate subdirectories
- Group related functionality together
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions for directories and files
- Maintain separation of concerns (data, scripts, outputs, configs, etc.)

## Proactive Innovation
- Suggest improvements, optimizations, and alternative approaches
- Recommend tools, libraries, or methodologies that could benefit the project
- Offer creative solutions even when not directly related to the current task
- Think beyond the immediate request to provide additional value
