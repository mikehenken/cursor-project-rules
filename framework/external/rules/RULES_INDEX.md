## üîÑ External Rules Access

### Symlink to External Rules
- `.cursor/external-rules/` - Symlink to external project rules
- Use for reference when developing external project features
- These rules are pulled into external Cursor projects

### External Rules Location
- `framework/external/rules/rules/` - External project rules
- These are the rules that external projects receive via MCP

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Framework Development
- **Consistent Quality**: All framework code follows the same standards
- **Better Documentation**: Clear guidelines for framework docs
- **Effective Testing**: Comprehensive testing requirements
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured framework code

### For External Projects
- **Proven Patterns**: Rules based on framework development experience
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines refined through framework development
- **Quality Assurance**: Standards that ensure project success

## üîß Maintenance

### Updating Framework Rules
1. Modify rules in this directory
2. Test with framework development
3. Deploy updated rules to external projects via MCP

### Syncing with External Rules
- Framework rules inform external rules
- External rules are derived from framework experience
- Both evolve together to maintain consistency
