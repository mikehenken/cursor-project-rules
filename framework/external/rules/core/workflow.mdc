## Workspace Rules
- Task-Driven Development: do not change code without an approved, explicit task
- Use Cursor todo lists; seek approval of task list and approach before executing
- No changes outside current task scope
- Avoid writing docs unless instructed; if needed, get approval first
- No emoticons in documentation
